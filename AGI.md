## AGI Prototyping

This AGI Prototype is based on batch of ordinary neural networks handled (enforced) by hormonal model copied from human (animal).
It makes possible artificial incentives and emotions. This model will work in role stimulator artificial cognitive processes.

Human is difficult but functionality can be decomposed on simple parts.

### Let's start with the stripped-down model and break down an example.

[TBD]

### Hormonal Model Fine Tuning

Human hormonal system has been tuned by evolution.
Artificial hormonal model can be more flexible and controlled.
